### useEffect is a built-in React hook used for handling side effects in functional components.

### It takes two arguments: a function and an optional dependency array.

### The function passed to useEffect is called the "effect" function. It contains the code for performing the side effect.

### The effect function is executed after the component renders, by default. This can be useful for tasks like data fetching, setting up event listeners, or updating the DOM.

### If you provide an empty dependency array ([]) as the second argument to useEffect, the effect will only run once, after the initial render. This is common for initialization tasks.

### If you provide a dependency array with variables, the effect will run whenever any of those variables change. This allows you to control when the effect should be executed, optimizing performance.

### Omitting the dependency array altogether means the effect runs after every render, which is useful for mimicking the behavior of componentDidUpdate in class components.
